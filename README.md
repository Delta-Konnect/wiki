  <summary><b>What is RFID?</b></summary>
  
  RFID can be seen as a modern barcode alternative. Because it's not based on optics but microwaves, you don't need direct line of sight. Reads are recognized up to 6 meters and 200 reads/second are possible. The technology (RFID @UHF band 920MHz) was introduced around 2005, but only now the tag costs fell under a critical price of $0.10 per tag. That's enough to make it interesting for thousands of companies that found it too expensive before.
