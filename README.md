  <summary><b>What is RFID?</b> <br />&nbsp; </summary> 
  
  RFID (**R**adio **F**requency **Id**entification) refers to automatic and contactless communication systems for object recognition.
A system essentially consists of the following components:

**Tag**

  Labels (also called "transponders" or "tags") can be attached to any object. A variety of different types are available. Labels can be attached via stickers, screws or fastened with cable ties or inserted into the existing inventory with epoxy resin.

**Reader incl. Antennas**

  The reader generates the necessary signal and monitors the desired area with the help of the connected antennas. The maximum range for label detection is up to 10 meters.

**Gateway**

  The gateway represents the process and control unit of the system. The data from the RFID reader is filtered here and passed on to the existing warehouse management system/ERP in real time.

  RFID can be seen as a modern barcode alternative. Because it's not based on optics but microwaves, you don't need direct line of sight. Reads are recognized up to 6 meters and 200 reads/second are possible. The technology (RFID @UHF band 920MHz) was introduced around 2005, but only now the tag costs fell under a critical price of $0.10 per tag. That's enough to make it interesting for thousands of companies that found it too expensive before.

  An Enterprise Ressource Planner is a comprehensive management software used by companies to manage their distribution/logistics, customer relations, sales, production, human ressources and many more in one place. It is practically the future of modern companies and seen consistent growth over the last years.
  
  One of the biggest providers are SAP (HANA), Oracle (Fusion), Microsoft (Dynamics 365), Infor and SAGE.

  Anyway, especially small and mid sized companies often still rely on separated systems where warehouse management and other departments use isolated applications.
